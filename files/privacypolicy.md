# Privacy Policy for OceanChat

We don’t share any of your data with third parties or anything like that. We do make logs though, just to improve the service!

## What We Collect
Each user gets a random ID (UUID) when they start chatting. We log chat messages to make sure everything's working and to help us make OceanChat better.

## What We Do with Your Data
The logs are just for us to see how things are going and to fix any issues. We don’t share your data with anyone else.

## Where Your Data Goes
Everything we log stays on our servers and we make sure it’s safe and secure.

## Your Rights
Want your logs deleted? No problem! If you know your UUID, just send an email to torberge@outlook.com. You can find your UUID in your browser’s local storage.

## Got Questions?
If you have any questions about this policy or anything else, send me an email at torberge@outlook.com.
